# launching the python script via this bash script is a work-around since otherwise the fasttext
# library wouldn't print properly to stdout when executed in a docker container, likely due to some
# internal unchangeable buffering. Unbuffering python didn't work at all, so the entire stdout of
# the python call is piped into a tmp file which is looped over and returned to the screen, until
# the training process has finished.
